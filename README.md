## Scene Descriptions

| Scene | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **ShelfScene** | Player organizes shelf-type items (e.g., cans, Jam, toilet rolls). |
| **CoolerScene** | Player organizes cooler-type items (e.g., yogurt, water, Apple). |


Each scene contains multiple drop zones that accept specific item categories.

## Drag & Drop System

- Tap or click on an item to **start dragging**.  
- While holding, move your finger to drag.  
- When you hover over a **valid drop zone**, the item will **snap** into place automatically.  
- Releasing the button/finger outside a valid zone will **cancel** the placement.  
- On mobile, only **one finger** drag is supported.

**How it works (technically):**
- A raycast from the camera detects draggable items (via `itemsLayer`).
- A `Plane` is created at the itemâ€™s depth for smooth world-space dragging.
- `ItemDragger` triggers events:  
  `OnDragStarted`, `OnZoneEntered`, `OnZoneExited`, `OnDragEnded`.

## Language Toggle Instructions

The game uses **Unity Localization** for multilingual support.

- Languages supported: **English**, **German**, **Spanish**.
- Language can be changed via the **dropdown** top of game scenes.
- Localization affects all UI text and item display names.
